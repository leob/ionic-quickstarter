***IMPORTANT NOTE:*** I've added two useful sections to the Wiki:

* [Release notes](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/Release-notes)
* [Tips and troubleshooting](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/Tips-and-troubleshooting)

Please make a habit of consulting these Wiki pages because they contain important information. 

Also I've updated the following sections (on Februari 26, 2016):

* [Common recipes](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/Common-recipes)
* [Unit testing and E2E Testing](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/Unit-testing-and-E2E-Testing)

I intend to keep this starter app up to date with the newest versions of Ionic etc, and to add features/improvements.
See [Todo and Roadmap](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/Todo-and-roadmap) on the Wiki, and feel free to
[contribute](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/Contributing).

***NOTE:*** this starter app is based on Ionic 1.x and Angular 1.x.

The upcoming new Ionic 2 release will, in all likelihood, address 80-90% of the issues which this starter app aims to
address (e.g. build system, SASS/styling, common Ionic 'gotchas' and so on). So, "post-Ionic 2" this starter (and most
other starters) will probably lose a lot of their relevance.

## Introduction

Ionic Quickstarter is based on the "tabs starter" project from Ionic, but has the following extras:

* An improved gulp.js file (with a build process optimized for production, with template caching etc)
* Improved project structure (a modular app structure suitable for bigger apps)
* Application script files (Javascript) will be automatically included in your index.html by the gulp build process  
* Per environment, you can define different values for constants (e.g. appKey and so on) which are then written into
  config.js by the appropriate gulp task
* Unit test support using Karma and Jasmine
* Typescript Definition Files ('tsd' files) which enable autocomplete/intelli-sense features when you use an IDE such
as WebStorm or Visual Studio
* Signup and login flow implemented with Firebase (with the flexibility to add other implementations)
* Support for the two main Ionic UI patterns: side menus and tabs, and an Intro screen with a Slider
* Includes some commonly used features, for instance form validation using ng-messages and improved logging
* For easier diagnostics and troubleshooting once your app is "out in the wild" (running on users' devices), you can
use remote logging with Logentries (see description on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/Setting-up-remote-logging-with-Logentries))
* Basic image support: Cordova camera, image cropping, storing images in local storage, and displaying images
* Supports internationalization (I18N) using the <a href="https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate"
target="_blank">angular-translate</a> library (currently only an English language file is supplied, it's easy to add
other languages)
* Provides workarounds for a number of well-known issues in Ionic apps (swipe to close menu, hardware back button etc)
* Incorporates a number of 'best practices' for AngularJS and Ionic (e.g. "Controller as" syntax)
* A modular SASS setup including some handy utility styles and best practices for customization of colors, fonts etc.
* Reusable services and directives containing some commonly used utility functions that you can call in your app 
* An 'appModule' utility function that makes managing your AngularJS modules slightly easier
* Currently based on Ionic v.1.2 and AngularJS 1.4; tested on 3 devices: iPhone 4, Android smartphone, Android tablet

The first two topics (Project structure and Gulp file) will be explained below.

To keep this README short (it's already too long), I'm putting the rest of the information on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki).

## Installation and usage

First, install ```nodejs```, ```cordova``` and the Ionic command line tools, as described on the <a
href="http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/" target="_blank">Ionic Getting Started</a> page.

It is also recommended to have the following command line tools installed:

```gulp``` and ```bower```

Check if these are installed, and if not install them 'globally' using ```npm``` with the "-g" (global) flag.

***Note:*** as described on Ionic's "Getting Started" page, the currently recommended version of ```nodejs``` is
version 4. Lower versions (0.x versions such as 0.10.x, 0.11.x or 0.12.x) are not recommended because they are quickly
becoming outdated as they do not support newer versions of ```nodejs``` based tools, and higher versions (5.x) do not
work yet at the moment.

The version I am currently using is v4.2.6, so that is what I would recommend (v4.2.6 or higher, but not v.5.x).

***Tip:*** instead of locally installing all of the above tools, an alternative may be to use the
<a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-box" target="_blank">Ionic Box</a>. This can be an attractive option,
especially for Windows users.

***Warning:*** there have been many complaints on the Ionic forum from people who are unable to get 'SASS' working on
their system. Typically they see this error:
 
```libsass bindings not found. Try reinstalling node-sass?```
 
For background on the issue, see:

http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/error-running-gulp-sass/32311
http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/libsass-bindings-not-found/27881

However, this problem **SHOULD** not occur when you install the quickstarter app, because I've upgraded ```gulp-sass```
to a version that should be compatible with both the 'old' and the 'new' nodejs versions.

Assuming that you have all of the above installed successfully, open a terminal and "cd" into the directory where you
want to install your app.

Run the following commands (note: below the app is named ```myapp```, replace this by your app's name):

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter
mv ionic-quickstarter myapp
cd myapp
</pre>

If you want to put your app under source control and you use Git, type the command:

<pre>
git init
</pre>

***NOTE:*** after ```git init``` the Git repo will still point to ```https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter``` as
the remote/upstream repo, as you can see by running the ```git remote -v``` command.

As a result, "git push" will not work (unless you would have commit rights to my git repo).

To fix this, change the remote repo, either using the proper ```git``` commands, or by editing the file
```.git/config``` in a text editor. If you open ```.git/config``` in a text editor, you will see these lines:

<pre>
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
</pre>

You can either remove these 3 lines completely, or change the ```url``` property to the desired remote repository URL.

***NOTE:*** the next step (editing ionic.project and config.xml to change the app name) is OPTIONAL. You can skip this
step and do it later (or not at all), if you want. If you want to do it, then edit the following two files using a text
editor:

<pre>
ionic.project
config.xml
</pre>

In these files, replace the name ```app``` with the name you want to give to your app as follows:

* in ```ionic.project```: at line 2 ("name": "app"), replace ```app``` with your app name
* in ```config.xml```: at line 2, replace ```com.ionicframework.app``` with your package name (e.g.
```com.mycompany.myapp```), and at line 3 replace ```app``` with your app name

Finish the installation by entering the following commands:

<pre>
npm install
bower install
ionic state restore --plugins
</pre>

Finally, if you want to add Android and/or iOS as a runtime platform, type one or both of the following commands:

<pre>
ionic platform add android
ionic platform add ios
</pre>

The project is now ready to run. To run it in a browser, type (I advise to ALWAYS use the ```-c``` option):

<pre>
ionic serve -c
</pre>

or any other variation, e.g. (using the "labs" feature, logging to the console, and defaulting to Chrome):

<pre>
ionic serve -l -c --browser google-chrome
</pre>

Click through the app: try the tabs, menus and so on.

If you click the menu item ```log out``` then you will be presented with the login page. In
development mode this is a 'fake' login page. To log in, simply type an arbitrary email address (can be fake too), and
for the password type the text ```password```.

***NOTE:*** if, after executing ```ionic serve``` you get a blank page in your browser with the message
```Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory ... index.html``` then it indicates that the "gulp-inject" process wasn't
able to create an index.html file from the index-template.html file.

In this happens, I would advise you to run "ionic serve" with the arguments '-l' and '-c', so:

<pre>
ionic serve -l -c
</pre>

In some cases, the addition of "-l" in itself seems to be already enough to fix the problem (not sure about this).

However if the problem remains, then look at the messages in your console (terminal) window, which were enabled through
the "-c" argument. Normally you should see an error message/stacktrace in the terminal/console which should tell you
what is going wrong.

One possible cause for the above error seems to be the ```libsass bindings not found``` error which was discussed
above. However as said above this error **SHOULD** not occur anymore since I've upgraded the ```gulp-sass``` version.

### Some notes on usage

I've set up the gulp file and the starter app in such a way that there are essentially 3 distinct 'modes':

* 'development' mode which is what you use when running "ionic serve" (running in the browser)
* 'test' mode: used when you run 'gulp test' or 'karma start'
* 'production' mode which is what you use with "gulp build" and "ionic run" (running on a device)

As I've currently set it up, these modes are quite different.

#### Development mode

In development mode, the gulp build process is simple: no minification, concatenation etc.

By default, in development mode, the various services (signup, login etc) use a "mock" implementation with fake data
(but you can easily override this through configuration parameters).

To define configuration parameters for development mode, add them to ```src/js/config/config-dev.json```.
The ```gulp``` build process will write these values to ```src/js/config/config.js```.

#### Production mode

In production mode (used on a real device), the gulp build process does a complete build including minification,
concatenation etc, and the app runs with 'real' services.

(e.g. the Firebase service for signup/login, but you can replace this with an implementation of your own)

To define configuration parameters for development mode, add them to ```src/js/config/config-prod.json```.
The ```gulp``` build process will write these values to ```src/js/config/config.js```.

#### Test mode

Test mode (karma/jasmine) also uses the 'lightweight' build process and 'mock' services.

We also support end-to-end (E2E) testing, see [here](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/E2E-Testing) for
details.

For more details on configuring and using development, test and production mode, see the
[Wiki](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki).

#### A note about "ionic upload" and the Ionic View app

Here is a warning for people who use the Ionic View app in conjunction with the ```ionic upload``` command to test
their app (by the way, I don't really recommend using Ionic View, see my comments about it on the Wiki).

If you do an ```ionic upload```, then by default it will take your app from the ```src``` folder, not from ```www```.
This is because ```ionic upload``` takes the setting from the ```ionic.project``` file.

So that would mean that you'd see a ***development*** build, not a ***production*** build, when viewing your app in
Ionic View.

If you don't want this (i.e. if you want a **production** build in Ionic View) then you should (temporarily) change
```src``` to ```www``` in ```ionic.project```, do a ```gulp build``` and a ```ionic upload```, and then change
ionic.project back to ```src```.

Note that the same principles apply if you want to test a **production** build under ```ionic serve``` (so not in the
Ionic View app but in a browser).

However in this case you need to take one extra step to prevent ```ionic serve``` from overwriting your production
build: you need to run ```ionic serve``` with the ```--nogulp``` argument.

So the workflow then becomes:

* temporarily change ```src``` to ```www``` in ```ionic.project```
* run the command: ```gulp build```
* run the command: ```ionic serve --nogulp```
* when you are done, change ```ionic.project``` back to ```src```

#### A note about the usage of Firebase for authentication

In production mode (if you run on a device with ```ionic build``` or ```ionic run```) then by default Firebase.com will
be used for login/authentication. This is because in "production mode" the settings in the ```config-prod.json``` file
are used, which set ```devMode = false``` and ```testMode = false```.

These flags, in turn, cause the user service to point to the Firebase.com implementation (see
https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/blob/master/src/js/app/user/services/user.service.js to understand how this
works).

If you want to run in production mode but do NOT want to use Firebase.com but another implementation (for instance the
'mock' implementation), then you can do this in two ways:

* modify the values in  ```config-prod.json```: if you set ```devMode = true``` then the "mock" user service
implementation will be used
* modify the code of https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/blob/master/src/js/app/user/services/user.service.js to
make it use the implementation that you want (for instance the 'mock' implementation)

For more details on configuring Firebase, see the
[wiki](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/Common-recipes).

#### A note about using the image functionality (Cordova Camera, image cropping)

The image functionality (taking a picture, cropping a picture, and so on) only works on a device, because it needs
Cordova, and camera hardware obviously. So, you will need to use 'production mode' (that is, ```gulp build``` and
```ionic run``` or ```ionic build```).

As explained in the previous section, in production mode authentication will use the Firebase.com implementation by
default.

If you do not want this, then you can change the values in the ```config-prod.json``` file, or you can change
the code of https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/blob/master/src/js/app/user/services/user.service.js (see the
explanation above).

For more details on using the image functionality, see the
[wiki](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/Common-recipes).

#### Adding libraries

If you want to add a Javascript library (pre-made JS component) to the app, you will need to go through the following
four steps.

(example used below: the "fus-messages" component, https://github.com/fusionalliance/fus-messages)

* Install it with bower, e.g: ```bower install fus-messages --save``` (this also updates your project's
```bower.json``` file).
* Add the library path (e.g. ```'./src/lib/fus-messages/dist/fus-messages.js'```) to your ```gulp.js``` file so that
```gulp build``` knows how to copy the library file(s) during the build. You need to add it to the ```lib``` section of
the ```paths``` variable in ```gulp.js```, and normally you would choose the minified version (ending in ```.min.js```)
of the library.
* Add the library path to your project's ```index-template.html``` file inside a ```script``` tag, for instance:
  ```<script src="lib/fus-messages/dist/fus-messages.js"></script>```
* Finally, add the library's module name (e.g. ```fusionMessages```) to the list of your app dependencies inside the
```app.module``` statement in your project's ```app.js``` file.

#### Troubleshooting modulerr errors in a production build

Sometimes, after doing a production build/run (```gulp build``` followed by ```ionic build``` or ```ionic run```) you
will see nothing but a blank page when starting the app on your device.

The most common cause is that you have the infamous AngularJS 'modulerr' error. To debug and fix this, please consult
[this](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/Troubleshooting-modulerr-errors-in-a-production-build) Wiki
page.

## Gulp file

The gulp.js file supports the following commands:

* ```gulp default``` and ```gulp watch```
* ```gulp jshint```
* ```gulp test``` and ```gulp test-single```
* ```gulp build```

Here is how you use these commands.

### Gulp default and gulp watch

Normally you don't run these commands manually. They will be executed automatically when you run ```ionic serve```.
This is done through a configuration section in the ```ionic.project``` file:

```
 "gulpStartupTasks": [
    "default",
    "watch"
 ]
```

### Gulp jshint

You can run this to hint/lint your Javascript code. Just execute:

```
gulp jshint
```

### Gulp test and gulp test-single

Use these commands to run your tests via the Karma test runner.

```gulp test``` runs the tests and then keeps watching (and re-running) them until you abort the command, while
```gulp test-single``` runs the tests only once and then exits. 

### Gulp build

You use this command to generate a production build to run on a real device. Invoke it like this:

```
gulp build
ionic run
```

Replace ```ionic run``` by ```ionic build``` if you want to perform a build instead of a run.

## Project structure

To support bigger apps, the starter app is structured differently than the basic 'tabs starter app'.

The tabs starter app lumps all the route definitions and controllers in one Javascript file, and puts the html
templates in a separate directory.

Instead, we've chosen to organize the files on a Module basis: each Module is in its own directory containing the
Javascript (controllers etc) and the HTML (templates) for that Module. This makes it easier to keep a large app
organized and maintainable.

As an example, here is the default structure (slightly simplified) after installing the starter app:

```
/
├── scss
│   └── ionic.app.scss
│
├── src
│   ├── css
│   │      
│   ├── img
│   │      
│   ├── js
│   │   ├── app
│   │   │   │
│   │   │   ├── auth
│   │   │   │   ├── forgotPassword
│   │   │   │   │   ├── forgotPassword.html
│   │   │   │   │   └── forgotPassword.js
│   │   │   │   │
│   │   │   │   ├── login
│   │   │   │   │    ├── loggedout.html
│   │   │   │   │    ├── login.html
│   │   │   │   │    ├── login.ctrl.js
│   │   │   │   │    ├── login.router.js
│   │   │   │   │    └── logout.ctrl.js
│   │   │   │   │
│   │   │   │   └── signup
│   │   │   │        ├── signup.ctrl.js
│   │   │   │        ├── signup.html
│   │   │   │        └── signup.router.js
│   │   │   │    
│   │   │   ├── user
│   │   │   │   ├── models
│   │   │   │   │   └── user.js
│   │   │   │   │       
│   │   │   │   └── services
│   │   │   │        ├── user.service.js
│   │   │   │        ├── mock
│   │   │   │        │   └── user.service.mockImpl.js
│   │   │   │        └── firebase
│   │   │   │            └── user.service.firebaseImpl.js
│   │   │   │      
│   │   │   app.js
│   │   │   
│   │   ├── config
│   │   │   ├── config-base.json
│   │   │   ├── config-dev.json
│   │   │   ├── config-prod.json
│   │   │   └── config.js  [GENERATED]
│   │   │   
│   │   ├── modules.js
│   │   │   
│   │   └── templates.js
│   │      
│   ├─── lib
│   │    ├── angular
│   │    ├── ionic
│   │    ├── ngCordova
│   │    └── firebase
│   │      
│   ├ index-template.html
│   └ index.html  [GENERATED]
│         
└── www
```

The structure shown above is slightly simplified, but the idea is as follows.

### Separate "src" and "www" directories

The app's sources (Javascript, HTML, CSS) sit under ```src``` instead of under the default location ```www```.

This is different than a 'standard' Ionic app, the reason is because of how the build process works.

During a production build (```gulp build```), the sources (under ```src```) are minified and concatenated and so on and
the products (build artifacts, the minified/concatenated files) are then placed in the ```www``` directory, where
Cordova (through the ```ionic run``` or ```ionic build``` process) will pick them up.

This setup keeps the sources under ```src``` cleanly separated from the build artifacts under ```www```.

### Modules

General principle: ONE DIRECTORY == ONE MODULE (and one subdirectory == 1 sub module).

So you can remove a module by removing that directory (but then you still need to remove the module reference from
app.js - the script include in index.html will be removed automatically by the build process).

Example: in the structure shown above you can see two Modules: 'app.auth' and 'app.user'.

'app.auth' has 3 sub modules: 'app.auth.login', 'app.auth.signup' and 'app.auth.forgotPassword'.

'app.user' does not have sub modules.

Each (sub)module is an AngularJS module ('angular.module(...')), and each module is in its own directory containing all
of the Javascript and HTML files making up that module.

In the example of the 'forgotPassword' module, you see that the directory contains 2 files: a template file
(forgotPassword.html) and a Javascript file (forgotPassword.js). The Javascript file contains the route definition
(UI-router $stateProvider) and the controller definition.

In the example of the 'login' module you see that the directory contains 5 files: 2 template files (login.html and
loggedOut.html) and 3 Javascript files. In this case you see that we've put the route definitions into a separate file
(login.router.js) and each of the two controllers also in separate files.

Whether or not to put the route definitions and controllers in one Javascript file or in separate files is up to you
and will probably depend on the complexity of the code ('forgotPassword' is simple enough for all the Javascript code
to be put into one file).

The 'app.user' module is a module that doesn't define controllers, routes or templates; it only contains services (and
models). However, it is perfectly possible (and often logical) to have a module that contains everything: controllers,
routes, templates, services and so on. An example of this is the 'app.mainPage' module (not shown above).

Note that during the production build process all of the separate files (Javascript and HTML) will be minified and
concatenated into one Javascript file for efficiency reasons.

**Note:** apart from the directory structure (the 1 directory == 1 module principle), we've also introduced a file
naming convention.

For instance:

Scripts defining in which controllers are defined are named 'feature.ctrl.js', where 'feature' is the name of the
feature, e.g. "login".

Scripts defining services are named 'feature.service.js', and their implementations (of any) are named
'feature.service.mockImpl.js', 'feature.service.firebaseImpl.js'.

The naming scheme is probably quite intuitive, but you can find a full explanation in the Wiki:
[Naming conventions](https://github.com/leob/ionic-quickstarter/wiki/naming-conventions).

### Services and mocks

Services which can be reused across modules are in a separate directory ```services```.

A service (for instance the UserService) can have multiple implementations, for instance a "mock" implementation and a
"Firebase" implementation. To illustrate, here is the code for userService.js:

```
angular.module('app.user')
  .factory('UserService', function ($injector, APP) {
    if (  APP.testMode) {
      return $injector.get('UserServiceMockImpl');
    } else {
      return $injector.get('UserServiceFirebaseImpl');
    }
  });
```

Depending on "flags" set in the config.js (in this case, APP.testMode), the factory instantiates either a Mock
implementation or a Firebase implementation of the user service. These implementations are in subdirectories below the
```service``` directory.

Using this approach, service implementations can easily be changed or swapped out without the client code (controllers
or other services) noticing anything.

The ability to run with 'mock' implementations makes it easy to develop quickly without having to perform a complicated
production setup, and in test mode, the mock implementations makes running your unit tests a lot faster of course.
